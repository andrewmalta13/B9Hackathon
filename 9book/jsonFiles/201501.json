NP. Group B. This class focuses upon the extraordinary music written by Franz Schubert in his last year of life. We analyze and discuss this music in great depth, with the goal of arriving at a thorough and sensitive understanding of it from an analytical and historical perspective. Pieces include the Quintet in C major, the last three piano sonatas, the Mass in E-flat Major, and several of the late songs. The primary purpose of the class is to gain an intimate and firsthand knowledge and understanding of Schubert's late music, so while some reading is assigned, the main emphasis is on doing our own analyses of this music. Readings are drawn from various sources, including Susan Wollenberg's Schubert's Fingerprints: Studies in the Instrumental Works, Leo Black's Franz Schubert: Music and Belief, Otto Erich Deutsch's Schubert: A Documentary Biography (trans. Eric Blom), and Suzannah Clark's article \"Schubert, Theory, and Analysis.\" Analytical methods used draw upon (but are not limited to) some aspects of Schenker's theory. As a reference point, we also review concepts of classical form, which will help elucidate some of Schubert's innovations and specific proportional features in the music. Course requirements include two substantive (twenty-page) papers, one due at midterm, the other at the end of the term, detailing the student's analyses of late Schubert; students choose which piece(s) to analyze, with approval of the instructor.

Perhaps no subject better illustrates this point than the environment, for to understand and appreciate the environment requires expertise from multiple intellectual traditions, including history, religion, philosophy, anthropology, aesthetics, economics, political science, and legal studies. This course focuses on the scholarship and practice of leading figures working at the intersection of law, environment, and religion, who will be brought to campus to participate in a discussion series that forms the core of the course. In preparation for these visits, teams of students are assigned to study deeply the writing and actions of a designated speaker. Class sessions during this preparatory phase resemble a traditional graduate seminar, with readings and discussion designed to stimulate engagement with the most challenging and vital questions facing the \"communion\" of law, environment, and religion. During the core phase of the course, speakers interact with students in multiple ways. The central activity is an in-depth interview led by members of the student team. Other students conduct a podcast interview with the speaker at Yale's audio recording studio; these podcast interviews, which are intended to engage the speaker in a more personal conversation about his or her life history, values, and worldviews, will be posted on Yale's iTunes University site. One of the conceits of the academy is often that such subjective elements have little bearing on one's intellectual work. As a result, too little attention is paid within the university to the role of family, community, religion, and other critical biographical factors in shaping one's ideas.

Organized around the arm of biopolitical inquiry that has developed in part out of the writings of Michel Foucault, this course focuses on the literary, historical, juridical, and scientific writings that influenced and reflected the ways that bodies and populations were conceptualized and administered in the United States from the early national period through the present. Beginning with late-eighteenth-century texts and the development of populational theories by such philosophers as Thomas Malthus and William Godwin, course readings include a wide array of writings from the eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries to historicize, contextualize, and theorize the role of biopower and deployment of biopolitics in the emergence of the security state. Each week is organized around a \"focus formation\" (e.g., eugenics, health, the prison industrial complex, etc.) in order to ground the theory in historical, social, and geopolitical realities, and we consider topics as far-reaching as sovereignty, state racism, war, demography, urban planning, social architecture, reproduction, birth, life, death, health, incarceration, criminalization, sex, addiction, and the optimization of labor, among others. The aim of this course is to allow students to develop a familiarity with some of the central theoretical and philosophical texts at the heart of biopolitical inquiry, and with the historical emergence of biopolitics more generally. No prior work in biopolitics required. Readings include Lemke's Biopolitics; Foucault's Society Must Be Defended, The History of Sexuality (vol. 1), Security, Territory, Population, and The Birth of Biopolitics; Giorgio Agamben's Homo Sacer and State of Exception; selections from the works of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri; Baucom's Specters of the Atlantic; and Harney and Moten's The Undercommons.", "title": "Introduction to Biopolitics", "professor": "Greta LaFleur", "readingPeriod": false, "professorRating": 0.0}, {"instructorPermissionRequired": "", "courseNum": "AMST 703 01", "OCInumber": 20565, "time": "W 3.30-5.20", "term": "Spring 2015", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "distReqAreas": "", "classRating": 0.0, "workRating": 0.0, "location": "WLH 209", "description": "An advanced survey course in feminist theory that covers key debates over the past three decades within feminist postcolonial scholarship.

Students read and present papers relevant to the molecular basis of the disease and cutting-edge approaches to its therapy. In the third session students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process.

Application of theory is accomplished through student use of hydrologic simulation models, which are expressions of theory and essential tools of water-resource management and assessment. Intended as a first course in scientific hydrology; appropriate for M.E.M., M.E.Sc., and Ph.D. students, as well as for advanced undergraduates. Because hydrology is a quantitative science, treatment of the course subject matter involves mathematics. The course is designed for students who typically do not have previous course work in mathematics beyond one semester of college-level calculus. Students who have not completed a college-level calculus course can succeed in this course provided that they are comfortable with arithmetic operations and algebra and are willing to learn a few, very basic principles of introductory calculus.

introduces the newly emerging field of religion and ecology and traces its development over the last several decades. It explores human relations to the natural world as differentiated in religious and cultural traditions. In particular, it investigates the symbolic and lived expressions of these interconnections in diverse religious texts, ethics, and practices. In addition, the course draws on the scientific field of ecology for an understanding of the dynamic processes of Earth's ecosystems. The course explores parallel developments in human-Earth relations defined as religious ecologies. Similarly, it identifies narratives that orient humans to the cosmos, namely, religious cosmologies. This six-week hybrid online course requires weekly in-person meetings and is offered for Yale students, both graduate and undergraduate. Two credits will be offered for the course. This course is a prerequisite for the other classes on World Religions and Ecology. This course meets on Wednesdays from January 14 to February 18. The syllabus, as well as preview videos and other pertinent information, can be found here: http://fore.research.yale.edu/yale-ma/online-courses-in-religion-and-ecology/.", "title": "Introduction to

an advanced level with the scholarship on ancient slavery and its relation to broader historical and sociological debates on the question of human bondage. Since antiquity, the subject has largely been shunned by historians. Only with the rise of the abolitionist movement in the nineteenth century did the question of slavery in the ancient world come to occupy scholarly interest. Debates were then fueled by the rise of Marxist historiography and its engagement with other sociological methods, especially Weberian and Polanyian approaches. With the decline of Marxist states, the subject cooled off in many circles but is now enjoying a return to vogue. The course surveys the major fields of inquiry into Roman slavery as discreet topics using primary and secondary materials, some in original languages. Students gain familiarity by reading and discussing, presenting their findings on a research topic of their choice, and writing up those findings in a research paper.", "title": "Slavery in the Roman

We will read major works in empiricism and moral philosophy, from Locke to Smith, alongside poetry and fiction in several genres. We'll ask, for example, how do poetry, fiction, and the visual arts recruit and account for perceptual experience or consider material and natural objects? What happens when the empirical psychology of consciousness or the categories of the sublime, beautiful, and picturesque take narrative or poetic form? What sort of ethical models follow from formal or generic decisions, from couplet structure, for example, or point of view?

The neurobiological components important in understanding symptom etiology and treatment are incorporated to select the most efficacious pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric disorders. Pharmacological history, differential diagnoses, and symptoms targeted for pharmacological activity are incorporated as integral components of prescriptive practice. An emphasis on clinical decision making includes all phases of pharmacologic treatment: evaluation and diagnosis; initiation of treatment; determining efficacy; evaluating side effects; enhancing patient adherence; evaluation of response long-term; maintenance vs. discontinuation; patient education; and integration of psychotherapy. Sources of information include evidence-based data, treatment algorithms, established practice guidelines, textbooks, journal articles, and current conference proceedings.

Ecology is being transformed from a field historically disengaged from the human built environment to one that can provide insight into the understanding, design, and management of the constructed world.

This reorientation has also catalyzed action-oriented initiatives. This course examines the current developments in urban ecology and looks at the transformative role it can play in shaping and managing urban environments. To this end, we examine fundamental issues in theory and practice that challenge the current understanding of urban ecosystems and that question the relationship between science and action in urban ecology.

This course explores the regulation by local governments of land uses in urban, rural, and suburban areas and the effect of development on the natural environment. The course helps students understand, in a practical way, how the environment can be protected through effective regulation at the local level. It introduces students to federal, state, and regional laws and programs that affect watershed protection and to the laws that delegate to local governments primary responsibility for decision making in the land use field. Theories of federalism, regionalism, states' rights, and localism are studied. The history of the delegation of planning and land use authority to local governments is traced, leading to an examination of local land use practices particularly as they relate to controlling development in and around watershed areas as well as regulatory response to sea-level rise and climate change. Course participants engage in empirical research working to identify, catalogue, and evaluate innovative local laws that successfully protect environmental functions and natural resources, and the manner in which towns, particularly on the coast, incorporate climate change into their planning and regulations. Nearby watersheds are used as a context for the students' understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of local planning and regulation. Attention is paid, in detail, to how the development of the land adversely affects natural resources and how these impacts can be mitigated through local planning and subsequent adoption of environmental regulations and regulations designed to promote sustainable development in a climate-changing world.

Environmental sustainability and human dignity are important societal goals, but figuring out how to achieve them on large scales\u2014geographic, temporal, and in terms of complexity\u2014has proven to be extremely challenging. Abundant trend data show that many species, ecosystems, and other environmental and human systems are being overused, stressed, or degraded, thus undercutting the likelihood that we can reach sustainability and human rights for all. In addition, our institutions for science, management, and policy are not designed to address sustainability challenges on these scales. Over the last few decades numerous management and policy initiatives have been put forward to address large-scale resource use, including single and multiple use, parks and protected areas, ecosystem management, bioregional planning, integrated conservation and development, transboundary approaches, and adaptive governance. This course (a mixed seminar and practicum) explicitly uses an integrative (i.e., via interdisciplinary) framework to examine the conceptual and contextual basis for these efforts; compares and contrasts their scientific, management, and policy components; explores themes of leadership, problem solving, decision making, governance, change, and learning; and surveys cases from three arenas (terrestrial, aquatic, and marine). The course takes a problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method approach that offers students conceptual, practical, and professional benefits. It includes readings, lectures, discussions, workshops, exercises, oral presentations, guest speakers, individual and small-group assignments, and possibly a field trip and group project. In past years the course took a field trip to the Connecticut River system to evaluate region-wide conservation efforts, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Grand Canyon Ecosystem.

It investigates the symbolic and lived expressions in religious ethics, and practices that can be defined as religious ecologies. Similarly, it identifies narratives in Confucianism, Daoism, and East Asian Buddhism that orient humans to the cosmos, namely, religious cosmologies. This interrelationship of narratives and religious environmentalism provides pathways into the study of religion and ecology.

The U.S. electric utility industry is a $370 billion business with capital expenditures on the order of $100 billion per year to replace aging infrastructure, implement new technologies, and meet new regulatory requirements. A reliable electricity infrastructure is essential for the U.S. economy and the health and safety of its citizens. The electric industry also has a significant impact on the environment. In the United States, electric power generation is responsible for about 40 percent of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. Electric utilities in the United States are at a crossroads. Technological innovations, improving economics, and regulatory incentives provide a transformational opportunity to implement demand-side resources and distributed energy technologies that will both lower emissions and improve service to customers. Such significant changes could, however, disrupt existing utility business models and therefore may not be fully supported by incumbent utilities. This course focuses on the issues, challenges, risks, and trade-offs associated with moving the U.S. utility industry toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

Too often paintings are looked at as disembodied images, while materials and techniques are addressed without taking pictorial needs into account. We approach both historical and contemporary works of art as handmade objects in which particular materials and processes are utilized toward specific goals. Traditionally, the discovery of new materials opened up previously unimagined possibilities for artistic practices, which led to the establishment of new pictorial facts. Simultaneously, ideological demands and pictorial needs of the age prompted experimentation with materials both familiar and unfamiliar, creating new techniques and ultimately new forms. This course gives students a greater understanding of the construction of a painting and helps them see if the needs of their own work are answered by their materials and resulting practices.

The trajectory begins at the moment portable cameras and recording decks were introduced to the consumer market in the late 1960s. With moving images and audio data, video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to be seen \u00e2\u0080\u009clive\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an event was actually being recorded and its sense of immediacy and relative accessibility made it attractive to artists more interested in concept and process than in objectmaking and marketability. Video and media art have exerted a powerful influence on the practices of all artists since the sixties. In the nascent years of video art, the only format available was videotape and television monitors the only means of display. Subsequently, wallfilling (and roomfilling) video projectors became affordable in the 1980s. The introduction of new formats of production, CDROM, DVD, and now Blue Ray, created a generation of work with increasing possibilities for expression and experimentation. The broader availability of other new technologies such as computer graphics, computer animation, interactivity, robotics, biotechnologies, and the infinite possibilities of communication through the internet, heralded the transformation of video art into media art. This course is an eyewitness account of these transformations to the present day. It links developments in video and media art to other contemporary expressions (music, performance, installation, and conceptual art), to changes in technology (from the Portapak to digital video), and to popular culture (music videos, YouTube, and podcasts).", "title": "Video and Beyond", "professor": "Barbara London", "readingPeriod": false, "professorRating": 0.0}, {"instructorPermissionRequired": "", "courseNum": "ART 951 01", "OCInumber": 24020, "time": "M 10.00-1.00", "term": "Spring 2015", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "distReqAreas": "", "classRating": 0.0, "workRating": 0.0, "location": "GREEN G10", "description": "This seminar focuses on facilitating the work of graduate students who are actively engaged in producing videos.

Has the regional human rights protection system been effective in addressing situations of gross violations? Have human rights-related criminal prosecutions been successful in the region? What are the current challenges in confronting state abuse and impunity of perpetrators in Latin America?
