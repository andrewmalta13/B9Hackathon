In the gospel style, beginning with the piano, students are encouraged to play by ear, using their aural skills in learning gospel music. This training extends to the organ, in the form of improvised introductions and varied accompaniments to hymns of all types.

Modern genres like concerto, monody, and solo song employed, on the one hand, techniques that were developed in the motet (e.g., counterpoint), yet on the other hand, they claimed the place of the motet as the leading vocal genre in church music. The course outlines the history of the motet in the crucial time between its peak in the sixteenth century (starting with Josquin) and its transition (or one might even say dissolution) into other genres in the seventeenth century (until Bach). The course combines a general overview with an in-depth study of selected composers. In addition to this analytical approach, the course looks at the religious context of this music-historical change of paradigm, as the transition from polyphonic music in the sixteenth century to soloistic genres in the seventeenth coincided with a change in piety around the turn of the century.

The goal is to become flexible using analytical tools that are fluid enough to be sensitive to each work, in order to arrive at a deep and thorough understanding of each piece. It is impossible to use only one analytical method when considering contemporary music, because there is no common syntax among pieces that would allow for a descriptive theory. It is therefore my goal to present various ways of analyzing non-tonal music. I talk about a range of tools, from a modified post-Schenkerian theory of linearity and directionality, to various strands of neo-Riemannian theory as presented by David Lewin, Richard Cohn, and others. Recent work by Alexander Rehding is touched upon, and we visit selections from The Oxford Handbook of Neo-Riemannian Music Theories. We also read, among other analyses, David Lewin's Musical Form and Transformation. The main goal of the course, however, is to develop our own ways of thinking about and understanding contemporary music.

The student develops skills in the art of pastoral care through a rigorous method of practice in the form of role-play and reflection enhanced by the foundational theories mentioned above. We spend significant time exploring specific issues and strategies commonly faced by pastors. The course presupposes that the task of pastoral care is primarily a theological one. Further, the focus of this course locates the primary context of pastoral care in the parish but not exclusively as the task of ordained clergy.

In the early days, American studies was imagined as a home for Emerson's American scholar; these days Emerson's scholar is apt to be eyed more skeptically.

Social science makes two contributions to the practice of development and conservation. First, it provides ways of thinking about, researching, and working with social groupings\u2014including rural households and communities, but also development and conservation institutions, states, and NGOs. This aspect includes relations between groups at all these levels, and the role of power in these relations. Second, social science tackles the analysis of the knowledge systems that implicitly shape development and conservation policy and impinge on practice. In other words, we analyze communities but also our own ideas of what communities are. We also examine our ideas about sustainable development and conservation, and we look at development and the institutions that implement it from the perspective of communities. The emphasis throughout is on how these things shape the practice of sustainable development and conservation. Case studies used in the course have been balanced as much as possible between Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America; most are rural and Third World (largely due to the development and conservation focus). The course includes readings from all noneconomic social sciences. Readings are equally focused on conservation and development. The goal of the course is to stimulate students to apply informed and critical thinking (which means not criticizing others, but questioning our own underlying assumptions) to whatever roles they may come to play in sustainable development and conservation, in order to move toward more environmentally and socially sustainable projects and policies. The course is also designed to help students shape future research by learning to ask questions that build on, but are unanswered by, the social science theory of conservation and development.", "professor": "Carol Carpenter"}, {"title": "Anthropology of Handmade Commodities", "OCInumber": 10610, "courseNum": "ANTH 631 01", "readingPeriod": false, "location": "SA10 212", "workRating": 0.0, "classRating": 0.0, "distReqAreas": "", "time": "W 1.30-3.20", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "term": "Fall 2014", "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "professorRating": 0.0, "description": "Permission of instructor required", "professor": "Narges Erami"}, {"title": "Archaeological Research and Proposal Development", "OCInumber": 10611, "courseNum": "ANTH 743 01", "readingPeriod": false, "location": "HLH51 101", "workRating": 0.0, "classRating": 0.0, "distReqAreas": "", "time": "F 9.25-11.15", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "term": "Fall 2014", "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "professorRating": 0.0, "description": "Permission of instructor required", "professor": "William Honeychurch"}, {"title": "Archaeological Research and Proposal Development", "OCInumber": 10612, "courseNum": "ARCG 743 01", "readingPeriod": false, "location": "HLH51 101", "workRating": 0.0, "classRating": 0.0, "distReqAreas": "", "time": "F 9.25-11.15", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "term": "Fall 2014", "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "professorRating": 0.0, "description": "Permission of instructor required", "professor": "William Honeychurch"}, {"title": "Contemporary Archaeological Theory", "OCInumber": 10613, "courseNum": "ANTH 748 01", "readingPeriod": false, "location": "HLH51 101", "workRating": 0.0, "classRating": 0.0, "distReqAreas": "", "time": "TTh 11.35-12.50", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "term": "Fall 2014", "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "professorRating": 0.0, "description": "This seminar explores contemporary theory in all of its diversity.

The first of the three sessions is devoted to a discussion of the clinical presentation, natural history, pathology, epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis of the disease process. During this session students have the opportunity to view gross or microscopic specimens of diseased tissue in association with members of the Pathology faculty. Students are assigned readings in pathology, pathophysiology, and clinical texts to prepare for the first class session. The second session focuses on translational aspects of the disease process. Students read and present papers relevant to the molecular basis of the disease and cutting-edge approaches to its therapy. In the third session students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Prior to the third session students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the group discusses its thoughts and impressions.

We trace the shifting intersections between cartographic technologies and literary form, moving from the \"cartographic revolution\" of the sixteenth century to the grand digital-spatial dream of Google Earth. Topics covered include spatial literacy in verbal and visual texts; cartographic technologies and instruments; maps in books and as books (atlases); and literary uses of various mapping practices (spiritual, geographic, conceptual, data-driven); these topics are anchored in readings of Cam\u00f5es's Lusiads, Voltaire's Candide, and Pynchon's Mason and Dixon, with a variety of complementary materials (travel accounts, navigational tracts, broadsides, poems, maps, globes, atlases).

We read the cycle drama in the context of other important genres including liturgical drama, morality plays, saints' plays, mummings and disguisings, and royal entries. Recent critical interest in the histories of performance leads us consider the difference enactment makes to the literary objects we study. But we also think about what it means to read a medieval play, particularly how the visual imagination works for a solitary reader. To this end, we investigate medieval artistic forms that touch the drama without (perhaps) being properly theatrical: liturgy, pageantry, song, spectacle, recitation, book illumination, sculpture, and stained glass. We also attend to the physical forms in which medieval drama is preserved\u2014i.e., the manuscripts in which we find the texts and performance records.", "professor": "Jessica Brantley"}, {"title": "Piers Plowman", "OCInumber": 10884, "courseNum": "ENGL 534 01", "readingPeriod": false, "location": "LC 319", "workRating": 0.0, "classRating": 0.0, "distReqAreas": "", "time": "Th 9.25-11.15", "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "term": "Fall 2014", "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "professorRating": 0.0, "description": "A study of Piers Plowman, the restless and wide-ranging poem probably authored by William Langland in three versions between the 1360s and about 1390.

We examine this central contention, tracing its formulation, evolution, digression, and eclipse from the waning decades of the nineteenth century to the 1960s. Drawing on the writings of architects, artists, critics, and historians, the seminar pays attention to those machines and mechanized processes that fascinated architects and historians, and considers these in relation to the parallel, yet distinct, ways that buildings served to mobilize and interpret literal as well as symbolic aspects of machines. Retracing this history of debates about mechanization provides an opportunity to reassess key assumptions and arguments about machines and their relationship to architectural production and discourse. Finally, we consider how, in the decades following WWII, mechanization gradually lost command of the narrative of modern architecture, asking how the waning of this dominance, (through notions such as second machine age, information society, post-industrial society, among others) comes to be registered in late-modern architecture, form, and space.

We examine climate change from an international perspective, with particular emphasis placed on the world's developing countries. The course opens with a brief review of the latest scientific findings, the most recent developments in climate change policy, and an overview of common tools that analysts use to examine the climate question. We then devote roughly half of the term to examining climate change impacts and adaptation and half to mitigation. In looking at impacts and adaptation, we examine social and biophysical vulnerabilities to environmental change and explore the policies and measures that have been proposed to minimize the impacts of climate change. In examining mitigation, we discuss technological options, policies, and socioeconomic impacts of mitigative measures. The course has a mixed lecture-discussion format.

In order to focus thinking and to help assemble the needed people and financial resources, many entrepreneurs write a business plan for their new venture. One of the best ways to learn how to write a business plan is to learn by doing\u2014a real plan for a real new venture. Entrepreneurs should be confident self-starters and flexible thinkers, with a large capacity for work and the ability to take the initiative, overcome obstacles, make things happen, and get things done. They must be persistent and able to thrive in an unstructured environment. Students enter their plans in the Yale Venture Challenge contest sponsored by the Yale Entrepreneurial Society. The scope of the work includes doing in-depth market, product, and competitor research; creating a strategy for a sustainable business; and writing and presenting a professional-quality plan (including a financial model and deal structure).

In the past thirty years, energy markets have changed from quiet, often heavily regulated areas of the business landscape to some of the most dynamic markets in the world economy. Regulation of oil, natural gas, and electricity markets has been reduced dramatically in the United States and in many other countries. Electricity deregulation swept the industrialized and developing world, but it is now associated with the 2000\u20132001 California electricity crisis and the 2001\u20132002 Enron scandal. Oil prices have reached record levels with great uncertainty about where they are headed. Drawing on the tools of economics, we study the business and public policy issues that these changes have raised. Topics include the competition in wholesale electricity markets, market power and antitrust, the economics of exhaustible resources, demand efficiency, and the transportation of energy commodities. We examine the economic determinants of industry structure and evolution of competition among firms in these industries, investigate successful and unsuccessful strategies for entering new markets and competing in existing markets, and analyze the rationale for and effects of public policies in energy markets. Students play strategy games to learn about wholesale electricity markets and for-profit firms in a restructured electricity market, and develop a carbon policy to implement during the game.

This course offers an explicit interdisciplinary (integrative) framework that is genuinely effective in practical problem solving. This unique skill set overcomes the routine ways of thinking and solving conservation problems common to many NGOs and government organizations by explicitly developing more rigorous and effective critical-thinking, observation, and management skills. It is genuinely interdisciplinary. By simultaneously addressing rational, political, and practical aspects of real-world problem solving, the course helps students gain skills, understand, and offer solutions to the policy problems of managing natural resources. The approach we use requires several things of students (or any problem solvers): that they be contextual in terms of social and decision-making processes; that they use multiple methods and epistemologies from any field that helps in understanding problems; that they strive to be both procedurally and substantively rational in their work; and, finally, that they be clear about their own standpoint relative to the problems at hand.

One cannot have a sensible discussion of accounting as assessing value without having some idea of what value means and how to think about it. Therefore, this course begins by exploring the basic determinants of value and the techniques used to assess it: discounting cash flow and risk/return analysis. These techniques are based on the timing and statistical properties of cash flow. With this introduction, the course then turns to the more fundamental processes of generating cash flow by creating value through the production and delivery of goods or services and then converting that value into cash flows.

The provision of mental health services is determined by many factors including policy, public demand, research evidence, ideas among general practitioners and mental health professionals, and the financial pressures under which purchasers and providers of services work. These groups often have widely disparate views about the nature of mental disorders and their most appropriate interventions. In providing services to individuals, families, groups, systems, and organizations, the advanced practice psychiatric nurse functions as clinician, consultant, leader, educator, and researcher in the analysis of critical issues important to decision making and intervention. The assumption underlying the course is that all advanced practice mental health services should be fundamentally theoretical and evidence-based. In this course students define clinical problems and system implications, use technology to identify clinical and research evidence, and critically analyze the evidence. Based on this analysis they devise and present realistic plans for intervention in the clinical setting and write an evidence-based review paper summarizing the results.

In this course, we question the evolution of the world trading system from a development perspective. A particular attention is paid to the \u201ctrade and\u2026\u201d issues: Is trade in services only in the interest of rich countries? Are trade rules a threat to public health and access to medicines in the poorest countries? Is trade part of the problem or the solution to climate change? How does trade affect food security and commodity prices fluctuations? Is currency under-evaluation a form of unfair competition? Is the cross-border movement of workers a source of brain drain or brain gain? Are high labor and environmental standards a form of diktat from the North?
