Then the course turns its attention to schools with some sort of religious orientation. After studying the heritage and tradition of such schools, we consider the issues involved in leading them today. The roles of school head, chaplain (lay or ordained), and the religion teacher are considered. The difficulties and delights of educational ministry and leadership are identified and discussed. Many aspects of school life are explored, including the pedagogical, pastoral, and liturgical. Naturally, issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality are raised by readings, case studies, role-plays, simulations, and visiting practitioners. Through required field trips, the course considers the problems and opportunities involved in inner-city schools and parish day schools.

We further examine the subsequent impact of that splitting apart on the contemporary dance, music, and art scenes in the United States. The 1909 to 1929 years are the primary focus of the course, with an emphasis on the musical masterworks that were born of Diaghilev's vision: works by Debussy, Milhaud, Poulenc, Prokofiev, Ravel, Satie, Respighi, Strauss, and, of course, Stravinsky, among many others. We examine how Diaghilev brought together many of the most influential artists of the time, such as Braque, Picasso, Chanel, Matisse, Derain, Mir\u00f3, de Chirico, Dali, and Cocteau, to collaborate with these composers. Students are given a brief primer on ballet and become familiar with the work of the important choreographers associated with the Ballets Russes, such as Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinksy (as both dancer and choreographer), L\u00e9onide Massine, and George Balanchine.

The experimental directions of Glass, Reich, and Riley had a massive impact on a generation of young composers and some older ones as well. Composers who were caught up in the movement's wake brought their own creativity to this new sensibility and helped to turn around the aesthetic direction of contemporary classical music. The list of composers is expansive, from J. Adams (and J.L. Adams as well) to P\u00e4rt, Rzewski, Kernis and Torke, G\u00f3recki, Bryars, M. Monk, L. Anderson, Lang, Gordon, Ligeti, Foss, Feldman, among others.

How does music imply narrative in the absence of text or story or program? How do listeners superimpose narrative on abstract musical sources, and how does that superimposition affect the way we think of music history?

Students read and present papers relevant to the molecular basis of the disease and cutting-edge approaches to its therapy. In the third session students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process.

These events he considered variously as signs and causes of the modern European crisis, its mixture of spiritual dissolution and utopianism. In reaction to these phenomena, which he witnessed while living in Paris, Manzoni devoted his creative efforts to clearing a path to a new literary and historical way of thinking.

Yet they are vital players in both democratic and nondemocratic regimes across the globe. Parties are essential for several basic political functions, ranging from representing societal interests, providing political alternatives, mobilizing voting publics, and even maintaining social control. It is thus essential for any serious student of democracy to understand how political parties emerge and function. This course seeks to introduce students to the big questions surrounding parties and party systems, with an emphasis on the non-Western world.

Because hydrology is a quantitative science, treatment of the course subject matter involves mathematics. The course is designed for students who typically do not have previous course work in mathematics beyond one semester of college-level calculus. Students who have not completed a college-level calculus course can succeed in the course provided that they are comfortable with arithmetic operations and algebra and are willing to learn a few, very basic principles of introductory calculus.

One-term senior essays are due at the end of the last week of classes in the fall term. In order to be considered for Distinction in the Major, students must submit three copies of their essay to the Economics department office two weeks prior to the last week of classes in the spring term. This is also the due date for two-term senior essays. Advisers are chosen with the assistance of the director of undergraduate studies. The format and character of the departmental senior essay may vary to suit the interest of the student and the demands of the topic, but it is expected that the tools and concepts of economic analysis will be employed and that the essay will contain original research. Paper lengths may vary; the normal expectation is thirty pages. Students may receive up to two credits for the senior essay, though it counts as only one departmental seminar whether one or two terms are taken. The first meeting is on Wednesday, August 29, from 4:30 to 5:20, or on Thursday, August 30, from 1:30 to 2:20, in Room 106, 28 Hillhouse Ave. Seniors planning to write a senior essay, including those who plan to write a spring-term essay, should attend this meeting.

This seminar explores topics in the anthropology of the global economy that are relevant to development and conservation policy and practice.

In fact, however, they have been examining global topics since at least the 1980s, and little current anthropological research is limited to the village level. More importantly, the anthropological perspective on the global economy is unique and important. This course examines the topics that make up this perspective, including how the rural, third-world household engages with the global economy (and how we understand the hybrid and multiple aspects of contemporary household economies); how the gendered division of labor and power over the allocation of labor plays out when migrant labor is added to the picture; how microcredit (the primary development solution to poverty) differs from traditional savings associations, and its variable effects across cultures; how capitalism dis-embedded economy from society, producing an \"immoral\" economy (and the history of theories of the moral economy); how property rights and the efforts to retain them shape indigenous livelihoods and the division of labor, as parks and private property claim land; how \"nature\" is commoditized, and how this creates poverty as well as the degradation of natural resources; and finally, what the capitalist frontier in the third world looks like, and how it reshapes landscapes and societies.

This research seminar explores the relationship between society and natural resources in a genuinely interdisciplinary manner.

In past years, the seminar focused on energy and the environment, interdisciplinary problem solving, and other topics. This year's seminar is on environmental psychology and sociology. It draws upon literature from psychology and sociology to deepen our understanding of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and human-nature relationships. Using literature reviews, case studies, guest speakers, our own self-examination, and research, we analyze how people's construction of self and \"worldviews/window on the world\" affect their decisions about their lives, nature, and the environment. Improvement and sustainability rest on change in ourselves and in other people. We focus on leadership (the lead and leader's relationships), too. Guests and students make presentations and participate in discussions each week. Readings, active participation, and student papers are required. The seminar overall looks at people seeking values using natural resources through institutions. This relationship (people, values, natural resources, and institutions) has been extensively written about and discussed in diverse fields. A few years ago, the seminar examined the relationship of human dignity as a universal value goal, professionalism and practice, and sustainability as an applied notion.

Icons and sculptures are used in worship; ritual apparatus and special robes are used in performance; and ritual altar and architecture are used to create sacred spaces. By exploring artworks in various media from East Asia, from painting and sculpture to architecture, as well as essential theories of ritual, this course questions whether current definitions of ritual distort and limit rather than illuminate our understanding of premodern ritual. Theoretical works by Jonathan Z. Smith, Alfred Gell, Catherine Bell, and other scholars are examined and discussed. Topics include the power of relics, material agency, nonhuman gaze, power of miniature, image worship, and imaginary pilgrimage. Artworks studied are largely from Buddhist and Daoist traditions, but the course considers them in a broader cross-cultural context. Students are encouraged to bring insight from their own perspectives and cultural traditions from the West, the Middle East, and other regions of Asia.", "finalDescription": "", "workRating": 0.0,

R is a computer programming language and computational environment that is freely available and cross compatible with Mac, Windows and Unix operating systems (see www.r-project.org). Biologists increasingly use R for statistics, graphing, modeling and data management because of its flexibility, power and shareability. While R can perform typical statistics and produce publication-quality graphics, it also allows the user to customize and archive their analyses as well as use code developed by others to conduct their own analyses.", "finalDescription": "", "workRating": 0.0, "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "distReqAreas": "", "term": "Spring 2013", "location": "OML", "classRating": 0.0, "time": "W 10.00-12.00", "readingPeriod": false, "professorRating": 0.0, "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "courseNum": "E&EB; 719 01", "OCInumber": 23906}, {"title": "Advanced Design Studio", "professor": "Brennan Buck", "description": "", "finalDescription": "", "workRating": 0.0, "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "distReqAreas": "", "term": "Spring 2013", "location": "RDH", "classRating": 0.0, "time": "MTh 2.00-6.00p", "readingPeriod": false, "professorRating": 0.0, "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "courseNum": "ARCH 1111 01", "OCInumber": 23907}, {"title": "Advanced Design Studio", "professor": "Aidan Doyle", "description": "", "finalDescription": "", "workRating": 0.0, "departmentPermissionRequired": false, "distReqAreas": "", "term": "Spring 2013", "location": "RDH", "classRating": 0.0, "time": "MTh 2.00-6.00p", "readingPeriod": false, "professorRating": 0.0, "instructorPermissionRequired": "", "courseNum": "ARCH 1112 01", "OCInumber": 23908}, {"title": "Topics in Morphology: Agreement", "professor": "Dennis Storoshenko", "description": "Survey of agreement and concord phenomena in the languages of the world.

The second half explores the role of nonprofits, NGOs, and multilateral institutions in the process of development. We study credit market failures and the gap filled by micro-credit institutions. We learn some strategies to evaluate the desirability and success of development projects in social marketing, poverty reduction, and microfinance.

We use these models to study the marketing of financial products (credit, insurance, savings), innovations in health, education, and other public services (immunizations, medicines, contraceptives, school enrollment), and innovations in agriculture (fertilizer, new varieties of seeds, and other technologies).
